## Overview

Together, flowering plants and flower-visiting animals account for about 1/3 of all described extant species of eukaryotic life on Earth. The trophic interface between flowers and florivores is, therefore, one of the chief foundations of global biodiversity, and patterns of floral resource availability can be expected to govern abundance, diversity, and functional relationships at higher trophic levels. **sweetworld** is a sandbox for exploring landscape-scale patterns of floral resource availability arising from simulated floral communities.

## Installation

`devtools::install_github("sponslerdb/floralcurves")`

## 1. Generate landscape

Landscape are generated with the function `landgen()`, which serves as a wrapper for functions in the package `landscapeR` [@Masante2017-aa]. At present, the function is hardcoded to produce a 3-class landscape (e.g. crop, forest, herbaceous), but I plan to make this more flexible in later versions of the package. 

The following code produces a 100 x 100 cell raster (`area = 10000`); if each cell is taken to represent 1 m^2^, the result is a one hectare landscape. Class 0 represents the background matrix on which patches of class 1 and class 2 are generated. The proportional abundance of classes 1 and 2 are controlled by `prop1` and `prop2`, respectively, with the proportional abundance of class 0 equal to 1 - (`prop1` + `prop2`). The grain size of the landscape is controlled by `n1` and `n2`, which determine the number of patches over which the total area of class 1 and class 2 are distributed. Note that patches can become contiguous.   

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
land1 <- landgen(area = 10000, 
                 prop1 = 0.6, 
                 prop2 = 0.2, 
                 n1 = 10, 
                 n2 = 10) 
```

## 2. Tabulate landscape

The next step is to tabulate the raster generated by `landgen`, simulate a floral community, and join that floral community to a table of floral traits. These steps are done by `landtab`.

Flora are assigned to landscape cells using the arguments `comp0`, `comp1`, and `comp2`, which control the floral composition of habitat classes 0, 1, and 2, respectively. In the simplest case, each habitat class could be assigned a single floral species. In most cases, though, we probably want to assign multiple species to one or more of the classes. In the code below, habitat class 1 is simulated as pure *Brassica napus*, representing oilseed rape fields, but classes 0 (representing non-crop herbaceous habitat) and 1 (representing forest) are assigned multiple species. If a habitat class is assigned multiple species, each landscape cell is assigned a single species drawn randomly from the vector of species assigned to the class to which it belongs. The relative abundance of each species within each class is controlled by the arguments `prob0`, `prob1`, and `prob2`, each of which consists of a vector of weights that govern the random sampling process. For ease of interpretation, these weights should sum to 1, but the base `R` function `sample()` that works behind the scenes of `landtab` will accept any vector of weights and automatically rescale them.

Once a plant species has been assigned to each cell of the landscape (now formatted as a row in a data table), we can add floral traits from a table specified by `traitTab`. Of course, one's choice of plant species above has to correspond to species present in the trait table. At minimum, this table must include the following traits:

1. Plant name (the name of this column can vary --- see `plantNames` argument)
2. `flower.density.peak` (flowers per square meter at peak bloom)
3. `bloom.start` (end of bloom, day of year)
4. `bloom.end` (end of bloom, day of year)
5. `bloom.peak` (end of bloom, day of year)
6. `sugar.per.flower` (micrograms of suger per flower per day)

In this case, our trait table is `baude_traits` (shipped with the package), which is a modification of the trait table provided by @Baude2016-hc (Supplemental Table 11). In addition to the required traits listed above, `baude_traits` includes a handful of functional traits that can be used to parse floral resource availability in ecologically meaningful ways. The argument `plantNames` simply gives the name of the column in the trait table that contains the plant names.
```{r}
land1_tab <- landtab(land1, 
                     comp0 = c("Cirsium vulgare", "Trifolium repens", "Taraxacum agg."),
                     comp1 = c("Brassica napus"),
                     comp2 = c("Acer pseudoplatanus", "Crataegus monogyna", "Sorbus aucuparia"),
                     prob0 = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3),
                     prob1 = c(1),
                     prob2 = c(0.8, 0.1, 0.1),
                     traitTab = baude_traits,
                     plantNames = "name.latin")
```

At this point, let's pause and appreciate the beautiful world we've simulated. 
```{r}
# Classes
plot1 <- ggplot(land1_tab, aes(x, y, fill = class)) +
  geom_raster() +
  theme_minimal(16) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(fill = "Patch class", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  coord_fixed()

# Plants
plot2 <- ggplot(land1_tab, aes(x, y, fill = plant)) +
  geom_raster() +
  theme_minimal(16) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "inferno") +
  labs(fill = "Plant sp.", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  coord_fixed()

plot1 / plot2
```

## 3. Extend landscape through time

Now that we have simulated our floral communities in terms of composition, we need to vary the floral density of each plant species through time according to a function representing its phenology. This is the job of `landpheno`. First, it takes the tabulated landscape and performs a crossing join with a vector of time steps defined by the arguments `first` and `last`. By default, these take the values of 0 (Jan 1) and 364 (Dec 31), generating a time series representing daily intervals for one year. Then, it calculates a triangular density function [@Carnell2019-aa] for each plant species using `bloom.start`, `bloom.peak`, and `bloom.end`. At `bloom.peak`, the function equals 1, and it declines linearly to 0 as it approach `bloom.start` and `bloom.end`. The value of this function is then multiplied by `flower.density.peak` for each plant species to calculate the floral density in each landscape cell on each day of the time series. Finally, flower density is multiplied by `sugar.per.flower` to get the total nectar sugar in each cell on each day.

This is the most computationally intensive step of the workflow, since it involves the generation of a data frame with (`last` - `first`) * `area` rows. For this reason, increasing the initial raster size beyond 100 x 100 is likely to cause memory problems relatively quickly. Simulating landscapes larger than 1 hectare could be achieved simply by imagining each cell to represent, say, 5 x 5 m and adjusting the interpretation of the model accordingly. 

```{r}
land1_pheno <- landpheno(land1_tab, first = 0, last = 364) 
```

At this juncture, we can pause again for visualization. By taking the mean sugar availability of each patch over monthly intervals, we can generate a short time series of maps that illustrate how the spatial distribution of floral resource availability varies through the year. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
land1_pheno_nest <- land1_pheno %>%
  group_by(time, date) %>%
  nest() %>%
  filter(date == "1970-03-01" | # when we convert day of year to date, it defaults to UNIX epoch
           date == "1970-04-01" |
           date == "1970-05-01" |
           date == "1970-06-01" |
           date == "1970-07-01" |
           date == "1970-08-01" |
           date == "1970-09-01" |
           date == "1970-10-01") %>%
  unnest(cols = data)

land1_pheno_monthly_mean <- land1_pheno %>%
  group_by(x, y, month) %>%
  summarize(mean.sugar = mean(sugar)) %>%
  filter(month %in% c("Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
                      "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct"))

ggplot(land1_pheno_monthly_mean, aes(x, y, fill = mean.sugar)) +
  geom_raster() +
  theme_minimal(14) +
  #scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "rocket", direction = -1) +
  labs(fill = "Sugar (g)", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  coord_fixed() +
  facet_wrap(~month, ncol = 4)
```


## 4. Tally landscape

Finally, we can focus on temporal patterns of floral resources by tallying the total sugar availability of the landscape for each time step (i.e. day). The function `landtally` performs this operation, optionally parsing total sugar availability by a given `criterion` corresponding to a categorical variable in the trait table (e.g. botanical family, floral morphotype) or the variable `class` representing the habitat classes of the initial raster.

```{r}
land1_tally_agg <- landtally(land1_pheno)

land1_tally_class <- landtally(land1_pheno, criterion = class)

land1_tally_plant <- landtally(land1_pheno, criterion = plant)

land1_tally_morph <- landtally(land1_pheno, criterion = flower.shape) 
```

With these tallied data, we can visualize variation in resource availability using line or area plots.

```{r}
ggplot(land1_tally_agg, aes(date, total.sugar)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(18) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Sugar (g)", title = "Aggregate")

ggplot(land1_tally_class, aes(date, total.sugar, color = class)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(18) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Total sugar (g)", color = "Habitat class",
       title = "By habitat class") 

ggplot(land1_tally_plant, aes(date, total.sugar, color = plant)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(18) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Total sugar (g)", color = "Plant sp.",
       title = "By plant species")

ggplot(land1_tally_morph, aes(date, total.sugar, color = flower.shape)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(18) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Total sugar (g)", color = "Floral morphotype",
       title = "By flower shape") 

ggplot(land1_tally_plant, aes(date, total.sugar, fill = plant)) +
  geom_area(color = "white") +
  theme_minimal(18) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "inferno", direction = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Total sugar (g)", fill = "Plant sp.",
       title = "By plant species") 

```
