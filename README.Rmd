## Overview

Together, flowering plants and flower-visiting animals account for about 1/3 of all described extant species of eukaryotic life on Earth. The trophic interface between flowers and florivores is, therefore, one of the chief foundations of global biodiversity, and patterns of floral resource availability can be expected to govern abundance, diversity, and functional relationships at higher trophic levels.  

`floralcurves` is a sandbox for exploring landscape-scale patterns of floral resource availability arising from simulated floral communities.

## Installation

```{r}
devtools::install_github("sponslerdb/floralcurves")
```

## 1. Generate landscape

Landscape are generated with the function `landgen()`, which serves as a wrapper for functions in the package `landscapeR` [@Masante2017-aa]. At present, the function is hardcoded to produce a 3-class landscape, but I plan to make this more flexible in later versions of the package. The following code produces a 100 x 100 cell raster (`area = 10000`) representing a one hectare landscape. Class 0 represents the background matrix on which patches of Class 1 and Class 2 are generated. The proportional abundance of Classes 1 and 2 are controlled by `prop1` and `prop2`, respectively, with the proportional abundance of Class 0 constrained to equal 1 - (`prop1` + `prop2`). The grain size of the landscape is controlled by `n1` and `n2`, which determine the number of patches over which the total area of Class 1 and Class 2 are distributed.  
```{r}
land1 <- landgen(area = 10000, # area of landscape in m2
                 prop1 = 0.5, 
                 prop2 = 0.1, 
                 n1 = 25, 
                 n2 = 25)
```
