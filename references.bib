  abstract  = "There is considerable concern over declines in insect pollinator
               communities and potential impacts on the pollination of crops
               and wildflowers. Among the multiple pressures facing
               pollinators, decreasing floral resources due to habitat loss and
               degradation has been suggested as a key contributing factor.
               However, a lack of quantitative data has hampered testing for
               historical changes in floral resources. Here we show that
               overall floral rewards can be estimated at a national scale by
               combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements. We
               find evidence for substantial losses in nectar resources in
               England and Wales between the 1930s and 1970s; however, total
               nectar provision in Great Britain as a whole had stabilized by
               1978, and increased from 1998 to 2007. These findings concur
               with trends in pollinator diversity, which declined in the
               mid-twentieth century but stabilized more recently. The
               diversity of nectar sources declined from 1978 to 1990 and
               thereafter in some habitats, with four plant species accounting
               for over 50\% of national nectar provision in 2007. Calcareous
               grassland, broadleaved woodland and neutral grassland are the
               habitats that produce the greatest amount of nectar per unit
               area from the most diverse sources, whereas arable land is the
               poorest with respect to amount of nectar per unit area and
               diversity of nectar sources. Although agri-environment schemes
               add resources to arable landscapes, their national contribution
               is low. Owing to their large area, improved grasslands could add
               substantially to national nectar provision if they were managed
               to increase floral resource provision. This national-scale
               assessment of floral resource provision affords new insights
               into the links between plant and pollinator declines, and offers
               considerable opportunities for conservation.",
